# c.
100 days of ui for [dailyui](http://dailyui.co/) and [may1reboot](http://www.may1reboot.com/)

## what is this?
it's the site i made as a **react** and velocity experiment which you can see here: [c.](http://100.chifra.net)

## stuff i used
* designs
  * paper, pencils, illustrator, after effects, photoshop
* web
  * vs code, typescript, react, velocity
* resources
  * unsplash.com, twitter

## how to use this
the site is set up as an express project, so you should be able to just:

1. clone
2. npm install
3. typings install (to get all our typescript defs)
4. run gulp tasks: 'js-deps' then 'transpile' or just 'release'

check it out - or just rip out any code/react components/css and just use them
